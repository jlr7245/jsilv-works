I'm a formally trained designer who decided to make the switch to development. Just as comfortable in JavaScript and CSS as I am in Sketch or Photoshop, I love both designing the look and feel of a new project and building it out to its completion.

I also love mazes, maps, puzzles, science fiction, and my wife.

Currently, I'm looking for the next challenge. Please feel free to get in touch with me.

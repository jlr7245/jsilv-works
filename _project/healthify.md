## What is Healthify?

Healthify is a simple web application built for fitness casuals who need an easy way of tracking the foods that they are eating. We believe that by using natural language to add foods & meals and creating an intuitive interface, we will achieve a higher rate of long-term engagement & more useful/actionable output for the user. We came up with this idea because many food tracking apps are too labor-intensive and focus too much on metrics.

Healthify was a group project between myself and a number of other students. Among other things, I was responsible for the styling; see below for my SCSS and Javascript relating to the user dashboard.
